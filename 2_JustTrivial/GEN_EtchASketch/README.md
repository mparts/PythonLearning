# Traditional Etch a Sketch

* Draw by moving the turtle (Controls are HOLD)
* W = Move Forward | S = Move Backwards | A = Turn Left | D = Turn Right


## Notes for improvement (section will probably stay unchanged until the heat death of the universe)

* change window size to fit screen? possibly full screen
* create main  menu | colour choices | play / exit button
* add functionality to also move with arrows
* add fuctionality of naming the sketches and saving them when done(maybe as png/jpg?)
  * if succesful add functionality of revisiting previous sketches
