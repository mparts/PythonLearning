# Horse Race but reimmagined with Turtles

* Type the colour of the rurtle you want to bet on


## Notes for improvement (section will probably stay unchanged until the heat death of the universe)

* change window size to fit screen? possibly full screen | make windows not overlapping
* move winner announcement from console to a pop up 
* change 'insert turtle colour box' to a slider, or box ticking etc.
* create main menu | play / exit button
* add betting fuctionality
  * player names with their winnings / debt
  * keep history of winning turtles, assign lower returns on winnings to turtles that win often and vice versa
  * Rig the game every now and then by turning the lowest winning turtle to SonicGoBoom
