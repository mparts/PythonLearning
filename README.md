# PythonLearning.. what even is this repository?

- This repo contains various simple projects that I created while I was learning python. It is there mostly for me to be able to work easier on them in case I want to revisit anything in there, since even if simple, I personally find some of these projects extremely interesting and at the same time a really nice way to experiment and/or play arround with the python language.
- Also, this is actually my first ever repo that I create so in continuation to the above bullet point, it is also a way for me to get more accustomed with git and github.
- There is some utility in some of the projects, others are nice little games and others are generic scripts.

## File structure and general Instructions

- There are three folders numbered from 1 to 3, depending on what I considered more interesting or less interesting / complex, this is not a hard rule, just a way for me to keep things a little bit more neat.
- Everything is named starting with three different letters GAM (game), UTI (utility), GEN (general).
- You can run almost everything without using venv since it is mostly built-in libraries that are being used. Though there are some cases that things need to be installed:

```bash
cd path/to/target
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Then after that, just use pip to install what is missing:

```bash
pip install target_import
```

- If an API key is needed you can put it in .secrets.txt (it is already ignored by git)

```bash
echo 'API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"' >> .secrets.txt
```

### Disclaimer

- Considering all the above, don't expect anything particular / magnificent by this repo, it is just a collection of nice little scripts, written by an inexperienced student entering the immense world of programming, trying to learn Python and at the same time familiarize with git/github. So basically, long story short, this repo is just a safe space for me to experiment.
- I am pretty sure nobody will ever use this repo since it isn't really of any use to be honest. But just in case anyone stumbles upon this.. I wish you a GREAT DAY and don't forget to HAVE FUN!!
