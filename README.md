# PythonLearning.. what even is this repository?

  * This repo contains various simple projects that I created while I was learning python. It is there mostly for me to be able to work easier on them in case I want to revisit anything in there, since even if simple, I personally find some of these projects extremely interesting and at the same time a really nice way to experiment and/or play arround with the python language.
  * Also, this is actually my first ever repo that I create so in continuation to the above bullet point, it is also a way for me to get more accustomed with git and github.
  * There is some utility in some of the projects, others are nice little games and others are generic scripts.


## File structure and general Instructions

  * There are three folders numbered from 1 to 3, depending on what I considered more interesting or less interesting / complex, this is not a hard rule, just a way for me to keep things a little bit more neat.
  * Everything is named starting with three different letters GAM (game), UTI (utility), GEN (general).
  * You can run almost everything without using venv since it is mostly built in libraries that are being used. In case something needs to be installed, it is already installed in a venv named '.venv' located in each file. So in case you have this whole repo opened as a single project, you will need to navigate in the specific directory that needs the import and activate the already created venv in there (if on linux $cd path/to/target and then $source .venv/bin/activate. In case you want to create your own venv, run this before running the $source command: $python3 -m venv .venv)


### Disclaimer

  * Considering all the above, don't expect anything particular / magnificent by this repo, it is just a collection of nice little scripts, written by an inexperienced student entering the immense world of programming.
  * I am pretty sure nobody will ever use this repo since it isn't really of any use to be honest. But just in case anyone stumbles upon this.. I wish you a GREAT DAY and HAVE FUN!!
