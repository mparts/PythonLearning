# The traditional snake game

* UpArrow = Move UP | DownArrow = Move Down | LeftArrow = Turn Left | RightArrow = Turn Right


## Notes for improvement (section will probably stay unchanged until the heat death of the universe)

* change window size to fit screen? possibly full screen | if not fullscreen, add visible boundaries
* add functionality to also play with wasd
* create main  menu | colour choices | play / exit button | show highscores button
* option for player name change & keep specific player highscore
