# The traditional pong game

* P1 (left): W = Move UP | S = Move DOWN
* P2 (right): UpArrow = Move UP | DownArrow = Move Down


## Notes for improvement (section will probably stay unchanged until the heat death of the universe)

* change window size to fit screen? possibly full screen | if not fullscreen add visible boundaries
* clunky controls & make players move faster
* create main  menu | colour choices | play / exit button | show highscores button
* option for player name change & keep specific player highscore
